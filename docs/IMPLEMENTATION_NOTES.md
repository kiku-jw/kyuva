## 2026-09-12 — Acceptance polish across Mac, iPhone, and Watch

### Decision

Preserve normalized prompt progress when visible geometry changes, including iPhone rotation and Mac overlay resizing. Present Voice Follow as an included on-device feature while commerce remains disabled, remove the redundant third Mac prompt action, and use Kyuva's lavender accent instead of cyan on Watch and in first-run onboarding. Onboarding now teaches the library, editor, prompt, and capture-preview flow that the redesigned app actually uses. Reserve Mac `1.1 (7)` and iPhone/Watch `1.0 (5)` for this acceptance candidate so it cannot be confused with Apple's processed Mac build 6 or the prior mobile build 4.

### Rationale

Device smoke testing exposed a large apparent jump backward when a running iPhone prompt rotated because the controller kept a pixel offset while its scrollable range changed. The other changes remove internal release language and visual drift from the public free experience without adding a new flow, dependency, or entitlement.

## 2026-09-01 — Readability parity before feature growth

### Decision

Close the iPhone prompt's typography gap before adding another product surface. The phone now exposes the same system, monospaced, serif, and rounded typefaces as Mac, plus logical leading, center, and trailing alignment. Keep these choices in the existing prompt settings flow and continue to defer recording, cloud, accounts, and new remote transports until owner acceptance.

### Rationale

The iPhone prompt previously hard-coded the system typeface and centered every script even though the shared product contract requires multiple writing systems and right-to-left content. Logical alignment labels preserve that intent, while navigation-style pickers remain legible at accessibility text sizes without adding permanent prompt chrome.

## 2026-08-30 — Core experience reset

### Decision

Replace the Mac Settings-led utility and iPhone dropdown editor with one legible sequence: library, editor, prompt. Keep Kyuva local-first and dependency-free. Pause Store submission, commerce activation, recording, cloud sync, team features, and new remote transports until the redesigned daily flow passes owner testing.

### Evidence

- Current Mac source launches into the camera overlay; script editing is buried in a five-tab Settings window.
- Current iPhone source combines script selection, editing, file actions, settings, and presentation in one dense screen.
- The installed Teleprompter.com Mac app and its current official product pages make library, search, script entry, and prompting separate, recognizable states. Relevant public references: <https://www.teleprompter.com/platform-features>, <https://www.teleprompter.com/features/voice-scrolling>, and <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teleprompter-com/id1420515755>.

No private competitor script content is copied into Kyuva, fixtures, screenshots, or documentation.

### Boundaries

- Preserve one local `ScriptManager`, on-device speech recognition, truthful capture behavior, fixed/WPM/duration pacing, mirroring, stage directions, WatchConnectivity, and disabled Release commerce.
- Do not restore Bonjour, network entitlements, iPhone-to-Mac remote behavior, account requirements, analytics, or a backend.
- User acceptance is required on the final Mac and iPhone builds before any new App Store submission.
